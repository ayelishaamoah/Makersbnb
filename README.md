### Makers Week 6 Group Challenge

## Headline specifications
* Any signed-up user can list a new space.
* Users can list multiple spaces.
* Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.
* Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.
* Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.
* Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space.
* Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.

## Nice-to-haves
* Users should receive an email whenever one of the following happens:
* They sign up
* They create a space
* They update a space
* A user requests to book their space
* They confirm a request
* They request to book a space
* Their request to book a space is confirmed
* Their request to book a space is denied
* Users should receive a text message to a provided number whenever one of the following happens:
* A user requests to book their space
* Their request to book a space is confirmed
* Their request to book a space is denied
* A ‘chat’ functionality once a space has been booked, allowing users whose space-booking request has been confirmed to chat with the user that owns that space
* Basic payment implementation though Stripe.
